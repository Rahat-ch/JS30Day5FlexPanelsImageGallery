# JS30Day5FlexPanelsImageGallery

Today's challenge was on Flexbox. Like Jon I know nothing of this. Though unlike Jon, now I know some stuff about it. I'll be looking over this again as I've always felt styling and positioning elements of a page has always been my weak spot. Flexbox is really helpful in getting different elements aligned and positioned properly, as well as for applying some amazing looking transitions. 

Very happy to be learning some CSS mixed in with the JavaScript on these lessons! 

As always the depoloyed project can be viewed below:
